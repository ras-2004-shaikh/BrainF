BrainF--- compiler and runtime

[![Ryan's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ras-2004-shaikh)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

This is just a simple BrainF compiler and code executer. It's still in the testing phases. I have a default 'code' variable in BrainF.cpp.
At the moment it has the mandelbrot set as the output. This is just milestone. Once I am satisfied with the efficiency of the code.
I'll modify it to read .bf files and a lot of other fun stuff I am planning ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
